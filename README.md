# FYP - Learning Objects

The Learning Objects project focuses on the development of web-based applications to complement the teaching material of courses taught over the 4-year MEng course in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The aim is to develop an interactive and accessible resource that students can use to test their understanding of course material outside of scheduled classes.
